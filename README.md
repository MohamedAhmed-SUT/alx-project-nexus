# ALX Project Nexus

## Overview
This repository documents my major learnings from the **ProDev Backend Engineering Program**.  
It serves as a knowledge hub to showcase my understanding of backend engineering concepts, tools, and best practices.

## Major Learnings

### 🔑 Key Technologies
- **Python** – Core programming language for backend development.
- **Django** – High-level web framework for building scalable applications.
- **REST APIs** – Designing and implementing standard APIs.
- **GraphQL** – Alternative to REST for more flexible data querying.
- **Docker** – Containerization for consistent environments.
- **CI/CD** – Automating builds, tests, and deployments.

### 📘 Important Backend Development Concepts
- **Database Design** – Structuring relational and non-relational databases effectively.
- **Asynchronous Programming** – Handling concurrent tasks for improved performance.
- **Caching Strategies** – Optimizing application performance with caching mechanisms.

### ⚡ Challenges Faced & Solutions
1. **Complex database migrations** → Solved by breaking down migrations into smaller steps and testing carefully.  
2. **Debugging async code** → Improved through structured logging and using async-friendly testing tools.  
3. **Environment inconsistencies** → Solved using Docker for uniform development and deployment.

### ✅ Best Practices & Personal Takeaways
- Write clean, modular, and testable code.  
- Prioritize security and performance in backend design.  
- Use version control (Git/GitHub) effectively for collaboration.  
- Embrace documentation to ease maintenance and knowledge sharing.  
- Collaborate with peers to learn faster and build better solutions.

## Collaboration – Key to Success

### 👥 Who to Collaborate With?
- **Fellow ProDev Backend Learners**  
  Exchange ideas, pair-program, and organize coding sessions.  
- **ProDev Frontend Learners**  
  Collaborate with them since they will use backend API endpoints for their projects.

### 💬 Where to Collaborate?
- **Discord Channel:** `#ProDevProjectNexus`  
  Connect with both Frontend and Backend learners.  
  Share ideas, ask/answer questions, and stay updated with announcements.

## 💡 ProDev Tip!
Use the **first week** to:  
- Communicate which project you are developing.  
- Identify ProDev Frontend learners working on the same project for seamless collaboration.  


# 🚀 Project Nexus – SmartShop API

## 📖 Project Idea
Build an e-commerce platform using the Django REST Framework.
The platform allows users to register and log in, browse products, add them to the shopping cart, and complete purchases.
The goal is to build a professional API that can be easily integrated with any frontend (e.g., React or Angular).

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Python 3.10+**
- **Django / Django REST Framework**
- **PostgreSQL** (as the main database)
- **Docker** (for managing development and deployment environments)
- **CI/CD using GitHub Actions** (for automated testing and deployment)

---

## 🎯 Features
- 🔐 **User Authentication & Authorization** (JWT)
- 📦 **CRUD for Products** (create/edit/view/delete)
- 🛒 **Shopping Cart & Orders**
- 🌐 **RESTful API Endpoints**
- ⚡ **Caching** for improved performance (Redis)
- ☁️ **Deployment** on Heroku or Render
